1.0 => 1.2

	There was no API level changes.
	Code which worked with version 1.0 must work with version 1.2 without
	any extra modifications.

0.8 => 1.0

Form and Toolbar:
	form@data => form@elements
	toolbar@data => toolbar@elements
	
	for all elements, you need to use 
	    view:"button" 
	instead of 
	    type:"button"
		
	Form inherits layout - use layout syntax (cols:[], rows:[] structures) to  place elements (sameLime property is not actual)
	    
	Sizing model of toolbar|form inputs changed, it will allow more flexible positioning, most probably you will need to adjust button's width and align settings:
	    width:200 => inputWidth:200
		position:"label-left" => labelPosition:"left"
	
	segmented@segment=>segmented@options
	tabbar@cells=>tabbar@options

DataProcessor:
    dataProcessor.link() => component.bind()

0.5 => 0.8

API was normalized:
	component names - lowercase without underscores
	methods and property names - camelCase  (for example, template_item - templateItem, start_on_monday - startOnMonday)
	unit_width property of "tabbar" form control - tabWidth
	
Names of some components was changed
	tabbar ( separate component ) => multiview 
	map		=>	googlemap

content view - deprecated, instead of it, template can be used
was
	{ view:"content", content:"html_container_id" }
now
	{ view:"template", content:"html_container_id" }

	

Changes in API 
	component.get(id)	=> component.item(id)
	component.set(id,data)	-	=> component.update(id,data)
	
	component.block()	=> component.unblockEvent()
	component.unblock()	=> component.blockEvent()
	
	
	

0.4 => 0.5

format of data XML for template | form was changed, old XML datasources will not work anymore
