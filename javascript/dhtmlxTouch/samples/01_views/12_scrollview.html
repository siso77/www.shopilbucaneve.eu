			But as the riper should by time decease,<br/>
			His tender heir might bear his memory:<br/>
			But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br/>
			Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,<br/>
			Making a famine where abundance lies,<br/>
			Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.<br/>
			Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament<br/>
			And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br/>
			Within thine own bud buriest thy content<br/>
			And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.<br/>
			Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br/>
			To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

			When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,<br/>
			And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,<br/>
			Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,<br/>
			Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:<br/>
			Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,<br/>
			Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,<br/>
			To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,<br/>
			Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.<br/>
			How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,<br/>
			If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine<br/>
			Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'<br/>
			Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br/>
			This were to be new made when thou art old,<br/>
			And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

			Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee<br/>

			For never-resting time leads summer on<br/>
			To hideous winter and confounds him there;<br/>
			Sap check'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br/>
			Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:<br/>

			Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
