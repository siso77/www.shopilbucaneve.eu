Together at lasttwo exquisitely sensual novels of the Marcelli family of California wine country . 
. . where wedding bells are ringing and love is in the air!
The Marcelli Bride
It takes one strong-hearted woman to make a rebel say I do, and for handsome, headstrong former Navy SEAL Joe Marcelli, that woman may just be the commander in chiefs daughter! After a terrifying kidnapping attempt, Darcy Jensen has been placed in hiding at the Marcelli Winery, the family business that Joe defiantly rejected to carve his own path. Now working undercover, Joe begrudgingly does his duty babysitting the first daughter. But getting closer to this fearful, fiery beauty soon proves to be the greatest pleasure hes ever known. Can Joe protect Darcy from danger, when hes falling dangerously in love?
The Marcelli Princess
Mia Marcelli awakens to find a man in her bedand nearly faints: four years ago, while working undercover, Diego, the love of her life and father of her unborn child, perished before her eyes. Now hes come to the Marcelli vineyard where Mia is raising an adorable son and offers a stunning confession: he was never Diego, but Rafael, Prince of Calandria, and Mias wary disbelief fades as their passion reignites. She doesnt know that he intends to give their boy a regal upbringing in Calandriaeven if he must seduce Mia into marriage. But as he falls for this luscious beauty, the prince must choose between his royal dutiesand the call of his heart.
