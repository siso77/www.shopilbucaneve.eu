Weve all pledged, promised and bullied ourselves to eat better and exercise more, but so many
 times even the best intentions fall short. I incorporate healthy habits into my work and home life and you can too. Dr. Mike Moreno
If you need to shed pounds fast and in a safe, effective, and lasting way, this is the book for you! Unlike many diet programs that starve you down to size, Dr. Mike Morenos 17 Day Diet relies on proven methods to help you take weight off and keep it off for goodwhether youve got 10 pounds to lose or 100. His revolutionary program adjusts your body metabolically so that you burn fat day in and day out. The program is structured around four 17 day cycles:
Acceleratethe rapid weight loss portion that helps flush sugar and fat storage from your system
Activatethe metabolic restart portion with alternating low and high calorie days to help shed body fatAchievethis phase is about learning to control portions and introducing new fitness routines
Arrivea combination of the first three cycles to keep good habits up for good. On weekends, enjoy your favorite foods!
Each cycle changes your calorie count and the food that youre eating. The variation that Dr. Mike calls body confusion keeps your metabolism guessing; this means that you can expect big changes in the first 17 days alone!
This is not a diet that relies on a tiny list of approved foods, grueling exercise routines, or unrealistic calorie counts that leave you hungry and unfulfilled. Moderation and proper portions are key factors in the 17 Day Dietthe trick is to figure out the foods and routines that work best with your real lifestyle. Thats why the book is filled with tips for how to avoid the usual food pitfalls like holidays, eating out, or even just a tempting candy jar. Along with a comprehensive explanation of how each segment works, every phase comes with an extensive list of foods, recipes, and sample meal plans to help make grocery shopping a breeze. Because of the diversity that you are allowed from the very beginning of the program, there is a way to make this diet work with almost any food allergies you might have or what cuisine youre used to eating.
The 17 Day Diet is a simple plan that gets big, long-lasting results if you stick with it and let Dr. Mike help you along the way. Whether this is your first attempt at dieting or your fiftieth, you must believe that you can do this. What matters now is focusing on your goals, identifying what you need to get there, and taking action to begin the process. Your health and happiness are important, so stand strong, believe in yourself, and let your 17 Day Diet begin now!
