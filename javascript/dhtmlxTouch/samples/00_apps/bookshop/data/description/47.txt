Foster McFee dreams of having her own cooking show like her idol, celebrity chef Sonny Kroll. 
Macon Dillard\'s goal is to be a documentary filmmaker. Foster\'s mother Rayka longs to be a headliner instead of a back-up singer. And Miss Charleena plans a triumphant return to Hollywood. Everyone has a dream, but nobody is even close to famous in the little town of Culpepper. Until some unexpected events shake the town and its inhabitants - and put their big ambitions to the test. Full of humor, unforgettable characters, surprises, and lots and lots of heart, this is Joan Bauer at her most engaging.
