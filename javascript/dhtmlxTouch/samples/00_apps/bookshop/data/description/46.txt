Eight-year-old Noah\'s problems seem easier to deal with if he doesn\'t think about them. So he
 runs away, taking an untrodden path through the forest.

Before long, he comes across a shop. But this is no ordinary shop: it\'s a toyshop, full of the most amazing toys, and brimming with the most wonderful magic. And here Noah meets a very unusual toymaker. The toymaker has a story to tell, and it\'s a story of adventure and wonder and broken promises. He takes Noah on a journey. A journey that will change his life.
