Whats Gotten into Us? is a deep, remarkable, and empowering investigation into the 
threatsbiological and environmentalthat chemicals now present in our daily lives.
 Do you know what chemicals are in your shampoo? How about your cosmetics? Do you know whats in the plastic water bottles you drink from, or the weed killer in your garage, or your childrens pajamas? If youre like most of us, the answer is probably no. But you also probably figured that most of these products were safe, and that someonethe manufacturers, the governmentwas looking out for you. The truth might surprise you.
After experiencing a health scare of his own, journalist McKay Jenkins set out to discover the truth about toxic chemicals, our alarming levels of exposure, and our governments utter failure to regulate them effectively. Whats Gotten into Us? reveals how dangerous, and how common, toxins are in the most ordinary things, and in the most familiar of places:
  Our water: Thanks to suburban sprawl and agricultural runoff, 97 percent of our nations rivers and streams are now contaminated with everything from herbicides to pharmaceutical drugs. 
 Our bodies: High levels of hormone-disrupting chemicals from cosmetics, flame-retardants from clothing and furniture, even long-banned substances like DDT and lead, are consistently showing up in human blood samples.
 Our homes: Many toxins lurk beneath our sinks and in our basements, of course, but did you know that theyre also found in wall-to-wall carpeting, plywood, and fabric softeners? 
 Our yards: Pesticides, fungicides, even common fertilizersthere are enormous, unseen costs to our national obsession with green, weed-free lawns. 
 Whats Gotten Into Us? is much more than a wake-up call. It offers numerous practical ways for us to regain some control over our lives, to make our own personal worlds a little less toxic. Inside, youll find ideas to help you make informed decisions about the products you buy, and to disentangle yourself from unhealthy products you dont needso that you and your family can start living healthier lives now, and in the years to come. Because, as this book shows, what you dont know can hurt you.
